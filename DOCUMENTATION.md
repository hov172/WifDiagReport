## Advanced WiFi Metrics Guide (New in v4.0)

### Understanding MCS Index
**Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS)** determines the data rate and signal quality of your WiFi connection:

- **802.11n (Wi-Fi 4)**: MCS 0-31
  - MCS 0-7: 1 spatial stream
  - MCS 8-15: 2 spatial streams  
  - MCS 16-23: 3 spatial streams
  - MCS 24-31: 4 spatial streams

- **802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5)**: MCS 0-9 per spatial stream
  - Higher MCS = better signal quality and data rates
  - Requires good signal strength and low interference

- **802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6)**: MCS 0-11 per spatial stream
  - Most advanced with highest efficiency
  - Supports more devices and better performance

### Spatial Streams (NSS)
**Number of Spatial Streams** indicates MIMO capability:
- **1 Stream**: Basic connection, lower throughput
- **2 Streams**: Standard for most devices, good performance
- **3-4 Streams**: High-performance devices, maximum throughput
- **8+ Streams**: Enterprise/high-end equipment

### Channel Width Impact
**Bandwidth allocation affects performance**:
- **20MHz**: Basic, congested areas, longer range
- **40MHz**: Standard, good balance of speed and range
- **80MHz**: High speed, shorter range, less congested
- **160MHz**: Maximum speed, latest devices only

### PHY Mode Evolution
- **802.11n (Wi-Fi 4)**: Up to 600 Mbps, 2.4/5 GHz
- **802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5)**: Up to 6.9 Gbps, 5 GHz only
- **802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6)**: Up to 9.6 Gbps, 2.4/5/6 GHz, improved efficiency

### Professional Analysis Tips
1. **Monitor MCS Index**: Higher values indicate better signal quality
2. **Check Spatial Streams**: More streams = potential for higher throughput
3. **Optimize Channel Width**: Balance between speed and coverage
4. **Upgrade PHY Mode**: Newer standards provide better performance and efficiency
5. **Use Coverage Mapping**: Visualize how these metrics vary across your space

## Sidebar Customization (for Techs, Admins, Deployments)

**Wifi Diagnostics Report** makes it easy for technical users to toggle feature visibility for non-technical end-usersâ€”**without code changes or custom builds**.

### How It Works

The app loads a bundled configuration file:  
**`WifiDialogReport/Configuration.plist`**

This file uses keys of the form `HideXXXX` for each feature or tool in the sidebar.

- Set the value to `<true/>` to **hide** a sidebar section or tool
- Set the value to `<false/>` to **show** that section/tool

#### Example: `Configuration.plist`
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>HideDeviceInfo</key>
    <true/>
    <key>HideWifiScanner</key>
    <false/>
    <key>HideCoverageMapping</key>
    <false/>
    <key>HideSpeedTesting</key>
    <false/>
    <key>HideExportSystem</key>

    <true/>
    <key>HideTechnicalFeatures</key>
    <false/>
    <key>HideHelpAndDocumentation</key>
    <false/>
</dict>
</plist>
