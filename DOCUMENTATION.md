## Sidebar Customization (for Techs, Admins, Deployments)

**Wifi Diagnostics Report** makes it easy for technical users to toggle feature visibility for non-technical end-users‚Äî**without code changes or custom builds**.

### How It Works

The app loads a bundled configuration file:  
**`WifiDialogReport/Configuration.plist`**

This file uses keys of the form `HideXXXX` for each feature or tool in the sidebar.

- Set the value to `<true/>` to **hide** a sidebar section or tool
- Set the value to `<false/>` to **show** that section/tool

#### Example: `Configuration.plist`
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
