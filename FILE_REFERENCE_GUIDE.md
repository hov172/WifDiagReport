# File Reference Guide: Wifi Diagnostics Report App

> **Platform Note:**  
> This project is **macOS ONLY**. Any iOS/`UIKit` files or references are obsoleteâ€”do not add, reference, or support iOS/Universal targets. The current codebase is built for macOS 13+ with SwiftUI.

This document serves as a lookup reference for developers and contributors, providing a high-level overview of which file is responsible for which part of the app. Use this to quickly determine where to make changes for new features, UI tweaks, bug fixes, or support tasks.

**Project Status:** Cleaned up July 2025 - Reduced from 70+ files to 31 essential Swift files

---

## Legacy & Backup Files

- **Files like `Untitled.swift`, `UIDevice+ModelName.swift`**  
  Legacy iOS-specific or unused files. Safe to delete unless referenced in import statements.

---

## Folder & File Organization Policy

- **`/Views/`** - User-facing screens and major view components
- **`/CoverageMapViewComponents/`** - Supporting components for coverage mapping feature
- **`/Models/`** - Data models and enums
- **Root level** - Managers, shared utilities, main views, and app lifecycle files
- **Remove/ignore any `.swift` files containing iOS/`UIKit` code** or legacy stubs not referenced in navigation or imports.

---

## Previews and Test Views

- Files with `#if DEBUG ..._Previews` are for Xcode previews and safe to edit. Does not affect production.

---

## State & Data Flow

- Uses `@EnvironmentObject` for "global" shared state (e.g. `DeviceInfoManager`, `SidebarConfig`).
- All primary screens access these models automatically as environment objects.  
- When adding a new shared state, inject it in `DeviceInfoUniversalAppApp.swift` and access it with `@EnvironmentObject` in your views.

## How to Add a Sidebar Feature â€” Step By Step

**Checklist for a new user-visible page:**

1. **Create a new file in `/Views/` (e.g. `Views/MyFeatureView.swift`).**
2. **Add a case to** the `NavigationSelection` enum in `ContentView.swift`:
```swift
enum NavigationSelection {
    // Add your new feature here
    case myFeature
}
