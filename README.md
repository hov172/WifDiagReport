## Sidebar Customization (for Techs, Admins, Deployments)

Wifi Diagnostics Report makes it easy for technical users to toggle feature visibility for non-technical end-users—without code changes or custom builds.

### How It Works

The app loads a bundled configuration file:  
WifiDialogReport/Configuration.plist

This file uses keys of the form HideXXXX for each feature or tool in the sidebar.

- Set the value to <true/> to hide a sidebar section or tool
- Set the value to <false/> to show that section/tool

#### Example: Configuration.plist
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>HideDashboard</key>
    <false/>
    <key>HideNetworkScanner</key>
    <false/>
    <key>HideSpeedTest</key>
    <false/>
    <key>HideCoverageMap</key>
    <false/>
    <key>HideNetworkHistory</key>
    <false/>
    <key>HideReal-timeMonitor</key>
    <false/>
    <key>HideHelp</key>
    <false/>
    <key>HideExport</key>
    <false/>
    <key>HideRunAll</key>
    <false/>
    <key>HideDebugExport</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
```

### Available Configuration Keys
