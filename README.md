## Sidebar Customization (for Techs, Admins, Deployments)

Wifi Diagnostics Report makes it easy for technical users to toggle feature visibility for non-technical end-usersâ€”without code changes or custom builds.

### How It Works

The app loads a bundled configuration file:  
WifiDialogReport/Configuration.plist

This file uses keys of the form HideXXXX for each feature or tool in the sidebar.

- Set the value to <true/> to hide a sidebar section or tool
- Set the value to <false/> to show that section/tool

#### Example: Configuration.plist
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>HideDashboard</key>
    <false/>
    <key>HideNetworkScanner</key>
    <false/>
    <key>HideSpeedTest</key>
    <false/>
    <key>HideCoverageMap</key>
    <false/>
    <key>HideNetworkHistory</key>
    <false/>
    <key>HideReal-timeMonitor</key>
    <false/>
    <key>HideHelp</key>
    <false/>
    <key>HideExport</key>
    <false/>
    <key>HideRunAll</key>
    <false/>
    <key>HideDebugExport</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
```

### Available Configuration Keys

| Key | Description | Default |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| HideDashboard |  Hide dashboard overview | false |
| HideNetworkScanner | Hide WiFi scanner tool | false |
| HideSpeedTest | Hide speed testing tool | false |
| HideCoverageMap | Hide coverage mapping tool | false |
| HideNetworkHistory | Hide network test history | false |
| HideReal-timeMonitor |  Hide real-time signal monitoring | false |
| HideHelp | Hide help documentation | false |
| HideExport | Hide export functionality | false |
| HideRunAll | Hide "Run All Tests" button | false |
| HideDebugExport | Hide debug export option | true |

### Updated Configuration
The configuration system has been updated to match all current sidebar sections and features. Make sure to use the exact key names shown above (including spaces) for proper functionality.
